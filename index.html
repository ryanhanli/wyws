                            <p class="text-intro">
                                "[A dream is] a vivid, complex, hallucinatory experience generally accepted as real by the dreamer, and having mostly logical progression in time" <br>-William Dement
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is no universally accepted definition for dreams, but almost all definitions include consciousness, recall accessibility, and occurence during sleep as characteristics.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since the beginning of time, dreams have fascinated us.  They have always been a part of humanity's story, guiding us in nearly every field of endeavor. Elias Howe dreamed of being attacked by cannibals.  He took note of the cannibals' spears, which had holes near the sharp tips.  Howe applied this concept to his new invention, the first working sewing machine. Dreams have been studied, worshipped, and practiced by nearly every culture throughout history.

                    <p class="text-intro">"Dreaming ties all mankind together" -Jack Kerouac</p>
                    <p>Dreaming is universal.  No matter our age, race, religion, occupation, and etc., we all dream, and we do so every single night. Some people claim that they don't dream, but what they really mean is that they don't remember their dreams. Many factors could contribute to this poor recall such as fear of revealing themselves, being too groggy to focus, recall, and report due to too deep of sleep, or drugs/medication.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dream recall is also very subjective relying solely on the memory of the dreamer themself since there are no direct ways to access dreams.  Thus, many of the methods used to measure dreams are far from perfect and have made dream research very difficult.</p>

                    <p class="text-intro">"The interpretation of dreams is the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind" -Sigmund Freud</p>
                    <p>There have been countless theories that attempt to explain dreams.  Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional, and physical well-being.  If you agree with the latter, then you accept the concept of the unconcious.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sigmund Freud similarly agreed with the latter and believed that all dreams were forms of wish fulfillment.  That is, dreams stem from our repressed conflicts and desires accumulated throughout life.  Dreams are our "unconcious" mind's attempts to resolve these past conflicts.  This could be why the content of our dreams is so confusing. Our unconcious mind may be trying to speak to us in symbols and metaphors.</p>

                  <p>
                  We often forget our dreams moments after we wake up unless we write them down.  Some of us don't even remember having any dreams in the first place.  Thankfully, dream recall is a skill and can be improved. <br> <br> Here are some ways to improve dream recall:

                            <p class="text-intro">
                                How do we interpret our dreams?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our dreams can have a multitude of meanings.  Some studies have suggested that dreams stem from the idea of "day residue," in which the the emotional themes and concerns that occur during one's waking life are prevalent in their dreams as well.  Our dreams can deliver these messages through intensified emotions, metaphors, and symbols.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Different types of dreams exist as well.  These include compensatory dreams, recurring dreams, precognitive dreams, nightmares, and lucid dreaming.  Compensatory dreams are the most common type of dream and is a way to fulfill our wishes.  They release pent up emotions, and supposedly restore balance to our psyche.  Recurring dreams try to get your attention and repeatedly occur as a result of process or stress/anxiety related reasons.  Precognitive dreams are foreshadowing telltales and nightmares are disturbing dreams.  Lucid dreams will be a topic of its own on this website later.

                <h1>Common Dream Symbols</h1>
                <p>Carl Jung described the concept of a collective unconcious, in which part of the unconscious mind is derived from ancestral memory and experience and is common to all humankind. Thus, we must understand the universality of a dream symbol and then look for a more personal meaning.</p>

                                Dreams can occur during NREM and REM sleep, but those that occur during REM sleep tend to be more frequent and vivid.  Common physiological changes that accompany REM include muscle relaxation, eye movement, faster respiration, and increased brain activity.  Furthermore, an area of the brain called the pons—where REM sleep signals originate—shuts off signals to the spinal cord. That causes the body to be immobile during REM sleep.

                                However, REM paralysis is not absolute. One may experience jerking limbs and erections as a result of autonomic nervous system activity.  The amygdala (aka "fear hub") is also highly activated in REM, which could explain the preponderance of negative emotion in dreams.  This combined with the fact that different neurotransmitters are active during NREM and REM sleep could be the reason why dream content differs between stages.

                  <h2><strong>Lucid Dreams</strong></h2>
                  <p class="text-intro">What are lucid dreams?  Why should we lucid dream?</p>
                  <p>Lucid dreaming is the ability to know you're dreaming while you're dreaming.  A lucid dreamer is able to go to sleep at night and wake up within his or her dream.  With this awareness, you can behave like someone who is awake, exercising the free will, imagination, and memory of waking life.  Once lucid, you can explore and even change elements of the dream.  Lucid dreaming will typically occur during REM sleep.</p>
                  <p>There are many benefits of lucid dreaming, and some of the most popular ones include: adventure and fantasy, facing nightmares, and creativity and inspiration.  Flying and having sex seem to the be first activities of the novice lucid dreamer.  Film Michel Gondry told <i>The Guardian</i> that when he becomes lucid, "I generally end up having sex with the first girl I can find."  Since physical laws and social boundaries don't exist in the dream world like they do here, lucidity provides the perfect playground for your fantasies to run free.  Additionally, we can seek to defuse our nightmares by exploring our fear and seeking inspiration through interacting with dream characters.</p>
